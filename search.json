    "text": "Our Approach: A Three-Pronged Attack\nWe tackled this complex problem with a three-step pipeline:\n\nPreprocessing\nVital Detection\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR)\n\nLet’s dive into each stage and explore the techniques that set our solution apart.\n\nPreprocessing: Setting the Stage\nThe first hurdle was isolating the monitor screen from its surroundings. We employed the YOLO v8-n model for this task, achieving impressive results.After segmentation, we applied a perspective transformation to standardize the monitor’s orientation and size, crucial for the subsequent stages.\n\n\nVital Detection: The Heart of the Matter\nThis stage in the pipeline aims to detect the appropriate vitals in the cropped and transformed monitor screen. However, there was a lot of unlabelled data, and manually annotating all 9000 images was not an option. And it will never be a good solution in any real-world scenario. We identified two methods to deal with the vast amount of unlabelled data.\nOne approach was to use a customized Semi-Supervised Learning Model, which would learn from the small amount of labelled data and use it to generate pseudo labels and then true labels for the unlabelled data.\nAnother approach was to intelligently pick and manually annotate a small amount of unlabelled data and then add it to the training dataset in order to bring maximum diversity and representation to the training data without much effort. This approach was chosen because of its better results and lesser computational requirement.\nFor vital detection, we utilized the YOLO v8-s model, which delivered outstanding performance.\n\n\nOCR: Deciphering the Digits\nThe final step was extracting the actual vital sign values. We opted for PaddleOCR, known for its accuracy and speed. However, this stage wasn’t without its challenges. We encountered issues like:\n\nMisreading similar characters (e.g., “0” as “O”)\nDetecting extraneous characters (like brackets)\nLosing digits due to segmentation errors\n\nTo address these, we implemented a series of logic-based checks and corrections, ensuring the most probable correct value was returned.\n##HR Graph Digitization Initially, we converted the HR graph segmented image into binary. In order to selectively obtain only the graph, the longest connected pixels row-wise were saved, and the rest discarded. The 2-D binary image was then projected into a 1-D Time Series. The plot was further rescaled in the x and y variables.",

Take everything with grain of salt since he is highly optiniated. When he learned the stuff, No Fast.ai then, Andrew Ng course was start. How school maths meant the things in ML was initial hook for him. He didn’t dabble in other subjects.\nAndrej Karpathy Andrej Karpathy says:- Spend 10000 hours quote, He wasn’t dubious in his choice, he was 100 percent sure that he wanted to just go into ML. Surface level knowledge just leads to suffering in which case if you are even able to build models, Models might fail silently and you won’t be able to understand why if you are not learning in deep. Spend time with subject you like, Maths is necessary but not university level, Calculus Linear Alg Prob, CS231n, Andrew NG, FastAI, Deep Learning Book Ean Goodfellow, Deep Learning with python, Grokking Machine Learning.\nImplementation is crux of most of the things, (Which paper did he implement?) Implementing the papers that align/ some part of those paper, gives a lot of learning, Balancing off understanding, intution, and how things work in practice, grokking/cramming alone never help, deep learning is often alchemy than science, Curious mind is necessary.\nHe didn’t start with a ML heavy job but it was clear to him totally that he will eventually. Having public record of our understanding is important so he started to write technical blogs, one way to write blog is write self reference, It was public record that got attention of employees (Where did he write ?) Forced himself on engineering side of ML, like deploying the mode, Docker/Kubernetes, Mentor at GSoC at TensorFlow, Publishing the tier-1 paper is really crazy, Got into hugging face because of public work, Open-Source,\nHe was not interested more education, He didn’t want to be research scientist, non-trivial public portfolio is really a thing that always helps, Matured Work Experience &gt;&gt;&gt; academic affliaition, Someone who have tensorflow contributions will always get more pref over stanford grad, Difficult Stuff =&gt; learning opportunities, You will always feel overwhelmed but carry on with those moments, Do not settle, Don’t be complecent, Sharpening the Sword - Have the same mindset as the one you had at the beginning. Reach out to other collaborators,\nA very nice doc of faqs he compiled, can be found at bit.ly/sayak-faqs\nQuestions :\n\nHe was working with Roberta and Bert sized model, He got comfortable then with codebase so he contributed to open issues, Connext took it him inside and after 6 months they reached out to him&gt;\nDoing things for open source is crux of HF\nYou have to build your case for yourself, make something that you can show to tell that I have expertise, Interview is not the way to go.\nOn his personal site he used to post blogs, it helps your own understanding and articulate it properly.\nInception you need to go deeper, regularization, SAM, 2018, High threshold for patience,\nProject should have enough thickness to show your expertize,\nEx: Finetuning is really easy but you can show maturity if you can tell why did you finetune&gt; Like prompt engineering didn’t work, RAG didn’t suffice then You curated custom dataset, then finetuned/\nKaggling is good, but focus on learning aspect rather than winning aspects.\nHow to Flash-Attention 2, Why not in C? How to find papers to be implemented. Youwill learn with time . During intital time randomly kicling a paper alinging with your field.\n\nNo cracked failure, its a Back and forth process, Focus on representativeness, no corruptions, check and check again. Tuning CV models with task rewards, RAG is beneficial for factuality, Do a Blog on YOLO, D2L.ai. Detection is far from saturation, contribute detection model to transformer.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKadam, Madhav. 2024. “Sayak Paul from Hugging Face.” April\n11, 2024. https://madhaviit.github.io/madhaviit/MyBlog/Blogs/Talk-by-Sayak/.",

    "text": "भारतीय संस्कृति के उद्यान में अनेक पंथ और संप्रदाय फूलों की तरह खिले हुए हैं। इन मनोहारी पुष्पों में से एक है वारकरी संप्रदाय, जिसकी सुगंध बारहवीं शताब्दी से दक्कन की धरती को महका रही है। यह संप्रदाय भगवान विठ्ठल की भक्ति का अमृत पान कराता है, जिनकी दिव्य मूर्ति पंढरपुर में विराजमान है। “वारकरी” शब्द स्वयं में एक कहानी छिपाए है - ‘वारी करने वाला’। वारी एक ऐसी तीर्थयात्रा है जो विभिन्न गाँवों से प्रारंभ होकर पंढरपुर की पावन भूमि पर समाप्त होती है। यह यात्रा केवल पैरों की नहीं, बल्कि आत्मा की भी यात्रा है। इस आध्यात्मिक उद्यान के मुख्य माली रहे हैं - ज्ञानेश्वर, तुकाराम, नामदेव और एकनाथ जैसे महान संत। इन दिव्य आत्माओं ने भक्ति के बीज बोए, जिन्होंने सत्य और निष्ठा की जड़ों को गहरा किया। वारकरी इसी पथ पर चलते हुए अपने जीवन रूपी वृक्ष को पल्लवित करते हैं।\nइस संप्रदाय की विशेषता है इसकी समानता की भावना। यहाँ छोटे-बड़े का भेद मिट जाता है, जैसे समुद्र में सभी नदियाँ एकाकार हो जाती हैं। यहाँ मान्यता है कि ईश्वर के नाम के जप से ही पुण्य का फल प्राप्त होता है। वारकरी परंपरा की समृद्धि इसके साहित्य, सिद्धांतों और इतिहास में निहित है, जैसे किसी कलश में अमृत भरा हो। साहित्य में सदियों की ऐसी कविताओं का भंडार है, जो सरल और मधुर भाषा में वह ज्ञान संप्रेषित कर पाती हैं, जिसे सैकड़ों महाकाव्य भी शायद नहीं व्यक्त कर पाते। उन कविताओं में जीवन का सत्य और अनुभवों की गहराई इस सहजता से रची है कि वे मन को छू जाती हैं, जैसे शीतल हवा आत्मा को शांति प्रदान करती है। यह संप्रदाय आत्मा और ईश्वर के अस्तित्व को स्वीकार करता है, मानो दो चिरंतन सत्य हों। इस आध्यात्मिक इमारत के निर्माण में अनेक संतों ने अपना योगदान दिया है। इसका सुंदर चित्रण इन पंक्तियों में किया गया है:\n\n“भागवतधर्मे कृपा झाली इमारत फळा आली ।\nज्ञानदेवे रचिला पाया उभारिले देवालया ।\nनामा तयाचा किंकर तेणे केला हा विस्तार ।\nजनार्दन एकनाथ खांब दिला भागवत ।\nतुका झालासे कळस भजन करा सावकाश ।\nबहिणी फडकती ध्वजा निरूपण आले ओजा ।”\n\nइन पंक्तियों में बताया गया है कि भागवत धर्म की कृपा से इस संप्रदाय की इमारत खड़ी हुई। ज्ञानदेव ने इसकी नींव रखी, नामदेव ने इसका विस्तार किया, एकनाथ ने इसे मजबूती प्रदान की, तुकाराम इसके शिखर बने, और बहिणाबाई ने इस पर ध्वज फहराया। संत ज्ञानेश्वर ने मानवता के महत्व को पसायदान के इन अमर शब्दों में व्यक्त किया:\n\n“जे खळांची व्यंकटी सांडो । तया सत्कर्मी रती वाढो ।\nभूतां परस्परे जडो । मैत्र जीवांचे ।।”\n\nअर्थात, दुष्टों की दुष्टता समाप्त हो और सत्कर्म में रुचि बढ़े, और सभी प्राणियों के बीच मैत्री का भाव जागे। वारकरी परंपरा में एक प्रसिद्ध दंतकथा है जिसमें कहा जाता है कि भगवान विठ्ठल भक्त पुंडलिक के लिए ईंट पर खड़े हो गए। यह कथा माता-पिता की सेवा के महत्व को उजागर करती है, मानो यह कह रही हो कि मनुष्य की सेवा ही ईश्वर की सेवा है। प्रकृति के प्रति प्रेम और सम्मान की भावना इन पंक्तियों में झलकती है:\n\n“वृक्षवल्ली आम्हां सोयरे वनचरे । पक्षीही सुस्वरे आळविती।”\n\nइसका अर्थ है कि वृक्ष और लताएँ हमारे रिश्तेदार हैं, वन के जीव हमारे मित्र हैं, और पक्षी भी मधुर स्वर में इसी बात को गाते हैं। यह पंक्ति पर्यावरण संतुलन के महत्व को रेखांकित करती है। गुरु का महत्व इस संप्रदाय में सर्वोपरि है। संत ज्ञानेश्वर के शब्दों में:\n\n“भावेविण देव न कळे निःसंदेह गुरूविण अनुभव कैसा कळे।”\n\nअर्थात, बिना भाव के ईश्वर का ज्ञान नहीं होता, और बिना गुरु के अनुभव कैसे प्राप्त हो सकता है। जीवन की पवित्रता पर बल देते हुए एक अभंग कहता है:\n\n“नाही निर्मळ जीवन काय करील साबण”\n\nइसका अर्थ है कि यदि जीवन निर्मल (पवित्र) नहीं है, तो साबुन क्या करेगा। यह पंक्ति हमें याद दिलाती है कि बाहरी शुद्धता से अधिक महत्वपूर्ण है आंतरिक शुद्धता।\nवारकरी संप्रदाय की शिक्षाएं सरल और व्यावहारिक हैं, जैसे किसी माँ का स्नेहिल मार्गदर्शन। ये शिक्षाएँ कहती हैं - अपने कर्तव्यों का पालन करते हुए भगवान को न भूलें। प्रातःकाल जल्दी उठें, स्नान के बाद गोपीचंदन का तिलक लगाएं, नियमित रूप से हरिपाठ का पाठ करें, संतों के ग्रंथों का अध्ययन करें, भगवान के दर्शन करें, पंढरपुर की यात्रा करें। सात्विक भोजन करें, हिंसा न करें, मांसाहार न करें। अच्छा आचरण रखें, परोपकारी बनें, परमार्थ की साधना करें। जीवन के बंधनों से धीरे-धीरे मुक्त होकर ईश्वर के साथ एकरूप होने का प्रयास करें।\nवारकरी संप्रदाय की एक उल्लेखनीय विशेषता यह है कि इसमें भागवतधर्म का अनुयायी बनना जन्मजात अधिकार नहीं है, अपितु यह व्यक्ति की स्वेच्छा पर निर्भर करता है। यह दृष्टिकोण इस संप्रदाय को अधिक समावेशी और उदार बनाता है, जहाँ किसी भी पृष्ठभूमि का व्यक्ति अपनी आध्यात्मिक यात्रा शुरू कर सकता है।\nइस संप्रदाय के सार को इन पंक्तियों में व्यक्त किया जा सकता है:\n\n“अध्यात्माने तृप्त जीवन । नाही कुठली खंत\nकरील मानवतेचे रक्षण । हा वारकरीपंथ ।।”\n\nअर्थात, वारकरी संप्रदाय एक ऐसा मार्ग है जो अध्यात्म से जीवन को तृप्त करता है और जो मानवता की रक्षा करता है। इस प्रकार, वारकरी संप्रदाय केवल एक धार्मिक आंदोलन नहीं, बल्कि एक समृद्ध जीवनधारा है जो सदियों से महाराष्ट्र की संस्कृति और समाज को प्रभावित कर रही है। यह संप्रदाय आध्यात्मिकता, मानवता और सामाजिक समरसता का एक अनूठा संगम है, जो आज के समय में भी उतना ही प्रासंगिक है जितना कि सदियों पहले था। वारकरी संप्रदाय की समृद्धि उसके अध्यात्म में है, और उसका अध्यात्म उसकी समृद्धि में। यह एक ऐसा पथ है जो अपने अनुयायियों के वैचारिक स्तर को उन्नत करने की अद्भुत क्षमता रखता है। वारकरी संप्रदाय एक ऐसा आध्यात्मिक पथ है जो हमें सिखाता है कि कैसे जीवन के प्रत्येक क्षण को एक तीर्थयात्रा में बदला जा सकता है। यह हमें याद दिलाता है कि सच्चा मंदिर हमारे हृदय में है, और सच्ची पूजा मानवता की सेवा में। यह संप्रदाय हमें आमंत्रित करता है कि हम भी इस आध्यात्मिक यात्रा में शामिल हों, जहाँ प्रत्येक कदम हमें ईश्वर के और करीब ले जाता है।\n\n\nThis article was originally written in Marathi without help from any GenAI models.

We indeed got many things right and must be proud of those achievements, while we also missed many opportunities. We cannot rest on partial victories. The mission is Viksit Bharat 2047. We must at least be a upper-middle-income nation, although that cannot be our sole ambition. The life of her citizens must be the north star. To achieve this, I propose a framework with a three-prong heuristic through which most policy and directives can take cue. First, prevent unnatural death. Second, increase life expectancy. Third, enrich that long and healthy life.\n\nThe First Prong: Prevent Unnatural Death\nThe most immediate duty of governance is the preservation of life. We must aggressively arrest unnatural deaths. This encompasses everything from maternal mortality to road accidents, from malnutrition to preventable diseases, from farmer suicides to industrial accidents. Every single unnatural death is in some way a failure of governance, a talent lost, a family shattered, and a future denied.\nWhen citizens do not feel safe, when accidents claim lives that could have been saved, or when disasters strike without adequate response systems, we fail at the basics. We need automated SOS alarm systems at scale that can respond to emergencies swiftly and effectively. This safety net must extend to economic survival as well. The surge in regional inequality that has forced millions to migrate must be reversed through townification. More of our population needs to shift out from agriculture, and we need to modernize our farming with machines and automation to reduce the burden on farmers struggling under economic distress.\nNational security is equally vital to preventing the loss of life and sovereignty. Digging a well when thirsty cannot be the national strategy. Two things India heavily imports are defense equipment and energy. We cannot afford to be highly dependent on others for our security or our energy needs. We must be competent in our strengths for a free-market world, and simultaneously, we must build self-reliance in every sector. A bit far fetched under this prong, we also need to ramp up space exploration.\n\n\nThe Second Prong: Extending Life Span\nOnce survival is secured, we must focus on the span of existence. Increasing life expectancy requires a holistic approach to health and environment. It begins before birth. For a nation with demography as one of its strongest assets, every child born must have access to proper nutrition in the first thousand days of life, not just from birth. This is when the foundation for a healthy, productive life is laid.\nThe reach of healthcare services must expand through targeted interventions. We need more primary health centers, more trained medical professionals in rural areas, and better health insurance coverage. Preventive healthcare should be prioritized over curative healthcare.\nHowever, medicine alone cannot guarantee a long life if our environment is toxic. Our cities need to be livable, breathable, and beautiful. No more should our cities be designed for cars. They should be designed for people, for walking, cycling, and using public transit, with parks, lush greenery, lakes, and playgrounds. Clean air and green spaces directly impact how long and how well we live. The transition to renewable energy is not just about economics; it is about securing our future in a world increasingly constrained by climate change.\nWe must also guard against the forces that shorten life from within. Addictions of different kinds are giving today’s youth a slow death. Whether substance abuse, screen addiction, or the more subtle addictions to instant gratification, we are losing a generation to these forces. We need better awareness, better treatment facilities, and a society that does not stigmatize those seeking help.\n\n\nThe Third Prong: Enriching the Life\nYet, what is the point of living long if that life lacks meaning, opportunity, beauty, and dignity? Education, cultural enrichment, economic opportunity, social harmony, and environmental aesthetics make life worth living.\nThis enrichment begins with education. The promise of education as the great equalizer remained largely unfulfilled. We need great public schooling, and institutions like Navodaya need big upgrades. The school curriculum needs to be more explorative but also harder. We can make it accessible without making it easy or dumbing it down. Higher education needs a revolution. The way to improve education in India is to put the best national and international minds as faculty. They won’t do it for salary; they will do it because they care. Teaching in native languages and Ancient Indian Knowledge are good initiatives but are very least impactful when fundamentals like basic infrastructure, quality teaching, student-teacher ratios, and learning outcomes are not fixed. Primary and secondary education must sensitise young adults on essential topics. We must arrest vulgarity in society spreading through mass media. Scientific temperament needs to reclaim front seat again.\nWe must create an ecosystem where talent thrives. The most important thing is having cities or even remote locations where foreign top talent can come, stay, and work. Brain drain has worsened because our best minds perceive limited pathways at home. When our environment fails to retain talent or attract global expertise, we compromise our ability to extend both the length and quality of life for all citizens.\nProsperity is the engine of a rich life. The means to prosperity is moving low-skilled labor to high-skilled jobs, which requires rethinking vocational training and labor laws. We must look beyond IT and services to manufacturing, green technology, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Artificial Intelligence and robotics hold immense promise. We must aggressively push for space exploration and aim for at least three spots out of the top 10 valued companies in the world. Furthermore, as a key data source in the modern world, we should monetize our data or control it with strong laws. Our demographic dividend can be our data dividend.\nCultural and aesthetic richness is equally important. Indian tourism is woefully underexploited. We have culture, history, and diversity that almost no country can match. Promoting tourism and our soft power through cinema, music, food, spirituality can open doors that hard power cannot. At the same time, we need to travel more internationally and expose ourselves more to other cultures. The world is full of beauty and we should embrace it in our lifetimes. We want efficiency, but we also crave beauty. Jumbled electric wires are aesthetically ugly. Our cities need to be pleasing to the eye, for aesthetics impact our mental well-being.\nFinally, a rich life requires a just society. Making sure that half of India gets representation in parliament is important; the number of women MPs has to increase rapidly. We need to strive for a society where individuals vote as citizens first, as Indians, not as members of narrower identities. The communalism offered to aspiring youthful India must end. Civil servants should have the courage and integrity to suggest what is best for the people. We need technologies like blockchain and ZKPs to make governance more efficient, transparent, and accountable.\n\n\nCompounding\nCompounding has immense power. To allow compounding of national progress, policies by and large should outlive the governments. Dialogue and broad consensus, decentralisation of power with clearer responsibilities helps ensure compounding by avoiding a single point of failure. Also, to not discourage thriving states, we need a better fund distribution algorithm which rewards good governance but also helps lagging states to catch up in other than financial means. Freebies, especially on backdrop of elections are extremely harmful as they take away the funds otherwise available for improving economic health. Radical technological innovation catalyses compounding manifold and IP protection, easier access to capital, no unnecessary bureaucratic red tape, culture of celebrating risk-taking and forgiving failures will help this happen.\n\n\nThe Pledge of 2047\nWe should ask, as a net result, does this help improve life? If the answer to all three prongs is no, we should reconsider. We don’t need premature juvenile pompous declarations of victory, What India truly needs is a silent redemption that is patient, persistent work where all arms of democracy fulfill their duties diligently. We need scientists in their labs, teachers in their classrooms, doctors in their clinics, engineers at their drawing boards, farmers in their fields, civil servants at their desks, and everyone and all working towards making India better.\nBy the end of 2047, when India celebrates a century of independence, we should be able to say that we redeemed the pledge our forefathers made. The ambition of the greatest people of our generation now must be to wipe every tear from every eye and then bring a smile to every lip. That is the north star. That is the ultimate filter.\nThe clock is ticking, and our destination 2047 is not as far away as it seems. Let us make sure we enjoy the journey. This is a road we must take because India deserves better, and her children deserve better. Humanity deserves better. Let us Make India Great Again, a country that is prosperous, just, free, and beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKadam, Madhav. 2026. “India@100.” January 1, 2026. https://madhaviit.github.io/madhaviit/MyBlog/Blogs/India@100/.",

    "title": "How to manage Academics in CSE engineering?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Academics in CSE engineering\n\nOne thing we either care too much about or we don’t care at all about is CGPA/CPI. Some say it has nothing to do with real work/ skills required out there in the world, some say one day before exam is all you need, some say it’s really important that if you regularly attend the classes and make good notes, you are good to go. All these are true up to some extent. Here is real picture what I have observed in last 6 semesters of my CSE Engineering.\nSo, most of the colleges start first year with a weird combo of everything, you like it or not (Situation may change with NEP). We like PCM when we study for Competitive exams because those are essentially oriented to challenge our mind logically but all engineering disciplines are not exactly as logical as what JEE was. There is theory, there is research then there are faculty biases and weird advices from seniors. So, many (including me) discard these subjects in our first year as useless and ruminate how bad our education system is. Now though your argument might not be flawed but to make it work you might need to go through a lengthy official channel so your juniors might benefit. But now you have at your hand, these subjects like Chemistry, Physics ,etc. {You know I love physics} Study these like you studied NCERT chapter from which certainly one or two questions pop and nobody (not really) likes to study them. Study only once well in advance before exam and just give a quick revision before exam, see and solve all PYQs twice (if faculty is in continuity). Study the Math as thoroughly as you can. Give economics a good shot at studying. Give good hand at programming as its essential to develop problem solving. Don’t fall prey to fear mongering of societies to induct you due to peer pressure. Sure try hard to get into top-notch technical clubs that have good track record (Cynaptics Club of IIT Indore😁). First year vacation go for God level CP/ internships (not ones on cheap sites.. networking is all you need (with fair assumption that you will nurture skills) to land a first year internship at good companies). Alas these details and many other things in some other md some other time.\nOne more thing, I started using Tablet in my third year for taking notes, and it doesn’t really makes a difference except it makes it easier to share your notes with your friends or not so friends. Having course maps, in which you just make graphs depicting what chapters, topics, sub-topics are taught, is really helpful in covering entire syllabus for exams and also helps you retrieve right concepts required for answering questions. If you feel slides are enough and if you are attending classes, just write day date and what were Headings in the lecture, will suffice to retain lot of things. Some profs have bias for good handwriting and good presentation in answer sheet ( Something to incorporate if you have luxury to do so). Having a study group is not at all essential but it helps while preparing for exams. One most important thing, don’t panic in exam if you feel you have not studied well since you can take cues from question but to do that you need open and calm brain. Manage sleep cycle well during exams (if you are prepared already, else burn your midnight oil but cover the material). Make sure to breakfast if you have exams in morning or have light lunch 2 hours before exam, if exam is in afternoon session. Reach exam hall on time, settle and cool down. Breathe slowly to gain composure. These are very basic things that our moms tell every exam day, but most of us live in hostels, so thought of mentioning these.\nLet’s move to Second and third year now, here you start with core subjects from CSE. Some of these course include DSA, DBMS, Automata (or TOC as is called), Discrete math, Computer Architecture(🥹), Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, ML, CV, Computational Intelligence, Optimization algorithms. Now, one thing all these course will offer you is good base especially if your university conducts good Labs associated with them. These courses are pretty standard and you can study them on your own if you wish. But what I have felt is attending few classes is certainly going to help you in terms of content. Either make your own notes, if slides are not provided, or have a good Note maker good-friend (As I was for many in my class). Why notes matter because profs are likely to teach, speak something not on slides with specific intention of putting these things in exam. If attendance carry marks, don’t miss classes please. Some courses are so damn scoring that attendance will decide final grade. If particular professor is known for strict (many call it vindictive) grading, attend all classes of such courses. PYQs are GODS for these courses. Just, make sure to solve (or study answers from instructor answer manual ) of exercises in the recommended textbook. It always helps those who solve (and ruins those who don’t💀). Now, how much and when is totally dependent on your priorities. One of my brilliant friends prefer having weekly reviews (despite you attend classes or not) to avoid last minute panic and a general sense of what is going on in course whereas I prefer attending classes. Do labs seriously, complete the exercises then and there, don’t wait for deadlines, do labs on your own (unless you are sure that there will be no lab exam and you have all the answers readymade from senior and you hate that subject). These are highly scoring courses. I have friends who have done way lot more things than me and managed to get near full grades. Also there are friends who have pursued everything from fun, joy and memorable experiences, bunked classes and still managed to do pretty good (🤘). Look definition of good is not same for everyone. But good academics mostly will make your way smoother and easier in whatever domain you see yourself going. Be it job market or be it research/ higher education. These two years are also stepping stones in transforming yourself into a skilled individual. So there is much more than academics in these two year and make sure you succeed there. Use all kind of tricks to save time from acads and to invest in yourself from solving CP questions / network / read my blogs in class which is ultimately disappointing or in a useless(for you) lab. Make sure to not get into unnecessary conflict with any prof / TAs.\n\nThis blog is written without any help from GenAI models.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKadam, Madhav. 2024. “How to Manage Academics in CSE\nEngineering?” July 25, 2024. https://madhaviit.github.io/madhaviit/MyBlog/Blogs/How-to-CSE/.",

    "text": "The rise of generative AI has ushered in a technological revolution reshaping how we interact with and leverage information. Long before ChatGPT captured global attention, I was fascinated by the immense potential of this field, researching cutting-edge applications like diffusion models for medical imaging. I have seen these technologies employed very innovatively. For example, learning the vocabulary of a new language with AI-curated multimodal content is engaging and enjoyable. Chatbots have become much more efficient in addressing customers’ primary concerns. Medical Imaging and Diffusion models are producing results with outstanding accuracy. Many social issues are of grave concern to me and can be solved with enough research and recent advances in Tech put in the right direction, like farmers’ distress due to lack of guidance and inequality of opportunity in Education. But this is just the brighter side.\nThe issue that concerns me the most is the dark patterns in the recommendation algorithms – a problem worsened by the complex generative AI models, the consequences of which I dread. Focused, advanced research in this field is urgently needed. A Netflix documentary “The Social Dilemma” exposed these dangers before the mass proliferation of generative AI, but today’s reality is even more alarming. Social networks and online platforms surround our day-to-day lives, serving purposes that range from relationship maintenance and discovering new connections to consuming entertainment and news content and facilitating commerce and self-expression. However, multiple research papers from studies across different nations have established that these very same platforms have also enabled darker use cases – from trolling and abuse to spreading misinformation and propaganda to even the nefarious manipulation of voters.\nTechnological developments in Recommendation algorithms and mighty powerful GenAI models (trained on the corpus of data with serious privacy concerns) present a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can make students learn better; on the other, it can even radicalize them. Extensive research is crucial to address these systems’ risks to our privacy and autonomy. Recommendation algorithms have resulted in the amplification of extremist content. They are not neutral. After all, recommendation systems are designed to keep us engaged by feeding us more of what we’re likely to click on, watch, or read. The more data they collect about our actions, the better they can predict and influence our future behaviour. But the implications go far beyond just shaping what content we see. By analysing small details, these platforms possess the capability to predict our actions, emotions, beliefs and even vulnerability to a surprising level of accuracy. All this deeply personal data exists in corporate databases, largely unprotected from misuse. Brands already leverage these insights to psychologically compel user actions, undergirding the online advertising industry.\nGenerative models which are trained on web crawls are able to correlate many of these things. By crawling over all the text (and, in recent years, videos and images as well) on the internet, including our social media trails, they can precisely mimic our language, communication styles, and personas. Identity theft has become much easier because of these platforms’ lack of new-age security measures. This ability to produce human-like content at scale enables hyper-personalization and targeting that is difficult to distinguish from authentic human engagement. With the powerful multimodal models, these models can also be tweaked to manufacture very realistic and believable misinformation, fake news, propaganda and armies of bots that can mass manipulate with hyper-personalization. Nation-states and bad actors may leverage this technology for surveillance, social control, and undermining democracy and social cohesion. I have experienced this issue playing a destructive, polarizing role in many events and campaigns. The hate, abuse and trolling one faces on these platforms is simply unbearable for most individuals.\nThus, robust research initiatives are crucially needed across several interrelated domains: human-computer interaction principles, robust authentication mechanisms, ethical web framework designs, unbiased recommendation algorithm development, and the responsible architecture of social networks and generative AI systems. While these endeavours are multifaceted, combining insights from each field can minimize the risks arising from the indiscriminate integration of AI across digital spheres. Ultimately, such collaborative research safeguards authentic human-to-human interactions from corrosive technological influences.\nFirstly, robust authentication systems and privacy-preserving approaches must be developed to safeguard user data and autonomy. Distributed systems can potentially mitigate risks of centralized data misuse by making it more difficult for any single entity to conspire. Moreover, establishing clear AI governance frameworks, regulations, and ethical training standards is imperative to ensure generative AI models are developed and deployed responsibly without perpetuating biases or infringing human rights. Recent initiatives like Snowflake’s transparent open-sourcing of their Arctic LLM represent a welcomed shift towards responsible AI research in the open. By embracing open-source philosophies and rigorous peer scrutiny, generative model development can become more accountable and aligned with ethical principles from the ground up. Secondly, extensive research is needed in human-computer interaction (HCI) principles and user interface (UI) design. This includes exploring mechanisms to provide users transparency into if/when they are interacting with AI systems, what data is being utilized, and how it influences recommendations or content curation. Interface designs should empower users to audit inferences made about them, object to unfair treatment, and manage their digital footprints consciously. Significant advancements must be made in distinguishing human-generated and AI-generated content across modalities like text, images, and videos. While extremely challenging, developing robust detection algorithms is crucial to combat misinformation, deception, and erosion of trust. Complementing this, Web 4.0 frameworks should incorporate intelligent ways to obfuscate personal data from indiscriminate crawling without user consent.\nWithout proactive human-centred interventions, we risk ceding our cognitive sovereignty and sleepwalking into a dystopian future of surveillance, manipulation and social fractioning on a societal scale. Maintaining privacy and human agency must be central priorities as generative AI breakthroughs rapidly reshape human-computer interaction.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY-SA 4.0CitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKadam, Madhav. 2024. “Guardrails.” April 22, 2024. https://madhaviit.github.io/madhaviit/MyBlog/Blogs/Guardrails/.",

    "text": "Today, we celebrate 75 years of independence, hard-fought and earned through the sacrifices of millions and millions. This is our moment, and we own it. At this auspicious moment, there are tons of opportunities and millions of traps ahead of us. The question is, are we wise enough to avoid the traps and grab the opportunities? Moreover, where do we, as a nation, look ahead?\nLong years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. These were the first few words of the First Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, from one of his greatest speeches when India became Independent. India needs to try to make herself an outward-looking and utterly free society. Free from fear and full of confidence that we as a nation will march together to greatness where each of us feels included. India must free herself from divisions of religions and castes and devote herself to science and innovation.\n\nWe are about to complete The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. According to our honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, this is an enthralling year filled with the elixir of energy of independence; the elixir of inspiration of the warriors of the freedom struggle; the elixir of new ideas and pledges; and the elixir of Aatmanirbharta. Therefore, this Mahotsav is a festival of awakening of the nation; festival of fulfilling the dream of good governance; and the festival of global peace and development. As we enter the Amrit Kal, let us look at this moment distantly.\n\nA moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India, and her people, and to the still larger cause of humanity. We must feel the freedom of that long-suppressed soul when we think about acting selfishly against the national interest. We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. Everyone must feel the pledge to serve this country in every way possible. We shall not forget the sacrifices of our forefathers who lived every breath to improve our beloved nation. The utterance that the soul found was of democracy and liberal values. We shall embrace it wholeheartedly, keeping aside momentary political gains. The diversity in India shall be celebrated with a sense of unity and not uniformity. There will be chaos in a nation of our size and diversity, but it should be constructive. India must move, slowly or fast, but in the forward direction. No way we can afford to go back.\nThe ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. This is the crux. We are obligated to uplift those who have not been advanced enough to have a life with even a bare minimum standard of living.

    "text": "Today, we celebrate 75 years of independence, hard-fought and earned through the sacrifices of millions and millions. This is our moment, and we own it. At this auspicious moment, there are tons of opportunities and millions of traps ahead of us. The question is, are we wise enough to avoid the traps and grab the opportunities? Moreover, where do we, as a nation, look ahead?\nLong years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. These were the first few words of the First Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, from one of his greatest speeches when India became Independent. India needs to try to make herself an outward-looking and utterly free society. Free from fear and full of confidence that we as a nation will march together to greatness where each of us feels included. India must free herself from divisions of religions and castes and devote herself to science and innovation.\n\nWe are about to complete The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. According to our honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, this is an enthralling year filled with the elixir of energy of independence; the elixir of inspiration of the warriors of the freedom struggle; the elixir of new ideas and pledges; and the elixir of Aatmanirbharta. Therefore, this Mahotsav is a festival of awakening of the nation; festival of fulfilling the dream of good governance; and the festival of global peace and development. As we enter the Amrit Kal, let us look at this moment distantly.\n\nA moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India, and her people, and to the still larger cause of humanity. We must feel the freedom of that long-suppressed soul when we think about acting selfishly against the national interest. We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. Everyone must feel the pledge to serve this country in every way possible. We shall not forget the sacrifices of our forefathers who lived every breath to improve our beloved nation. The utterance that the soul found was of democracy and liberal values. We shall embrace it wholeheartedly, keeping aside momentary political gains. The diversity in India shall be celebrated with a sense of unity and not uniformity. There will be chaos in a nation of our size and diversity, but it should be constructive. India must move, slowly or fast, but in the forward direction. No way we can afford to go back.\nThe ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. This is the crux. We are obligated to uplift those who have not been advanced enough to have a life with even a bare minimum standard of living. We need to raise even those bare minimum standards as fast as possible. It is said that education is tigress’ milk. We also need to build world-class institutions for mutual exchange of wisdom from other nations. India should also make space research more collaborative so that even the sky is not our limit.\nTo the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell. We shall embark on values of tolerance that we inherited. We shall be aware and brave enough that our tolerance may not be conceived as a weakness. We are a young nation. We must appreciate the successful youth, but we seriously need to look at a generation that has been completely lost in the virtual world, which I fear threatens the real zeal for a better life, education, and opportunities. The voices of women were heard and empowered. Nevertheless, still, we are far from saying that we have liberated the ladies of this nation from patriarchy.

    "text": "What did Seniors advise??\n\nAs I sat with my seniors, they shared their unique perspectives on preparing for interviews. I was reminded of the quote, “The secret of getting ahead is getting started.”\nDeepkamal, a seasoned ICPC World Finalist in his 4th year, emphasized the significance of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for job placements. He mentioned that Competitive Programming (CP) isn’t obligatory but stressed the utmost importance of DSA. He advised against any form of cheating and suggested using Leetcode as the best approach to excel. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of a strong grasp of Database Management Systems (DBMS) and recommended Interviewbit as a well-structured preparation platform. He cautioned against falling for the trap of paid courses and suggested that 30 days are adequate for Interviewbit preparation.\nJainil recommends focusing on writing clean and precise code and emphasizes the importance of algorithms for machine learning enthusiasts. He suggests not immediately looking for a solution when you’re a beginner and recommends spending a maximum of an hour on a problem as you progress. He also advises against doing competitive programming just for the sake of it and stresses the importance of being able to explain your solutions in interviews. Jainil also suggests preparing well for database management systems, object-oriented programming, and being able to explain your projects and introductions. He recommends focusing on the “why” factor in projects. Additionally, Jainil advises against copying projects and suggests preparing a questionnaire in case you face tough questions during an interview.\nKushan was really into certificates and preferred paper and research internships over corporate jobs. He had a published paper with Nagendra Sir and a strong GRE score. He recommended focusing on strong SOP and LOR for Masters and having a good CPI.\nSruthi stressed having some dream companies as they keep up your motivation. Satya Bhaiya, who happens to be the placement manager from the CSE department, coordinated this discussion. He also explained how to prepare a good CV and resume. From my year, Mihir Patel had doubts about consulting and was looking at ISB as an option. As the conversation progressed, the importance of mock interviews and solving puzzles in Interview-bit became apparent. Sound basics of C/C++ also seemed to be a crucial skill. All the seniors thoroughly answered my doubts regarding R&D roles. They advised ML enthusiasts, “You can start working in startups or go for a research internship.”\nListening to these bright minds and their journey, the ups and downs they have gone through, I could not help but think of the famous quote - “The only impossible journey is the one you never begin.” These words echoed in my mind as I left the session after a photograph with all the seniors, ready to start preparing for my own interviews.\nSince my notes were very brief, I used ChatGPT to curate this blog.

This place runs like a well-oiled machine! Although NUS had arranged transportation, I decided to grab a taxi for a quick tour of the city before hitting the sack. As we zipped past gleaming skyscrapers and lush greenery, I felt a tingle of excitement for the week ahead. The NUS campus welcomed me with open arms (and comfy accommodation). As I settled in, I decided to take a stroll around University town with other fellows and had intros and handshakes with a lot of people. What groundbreaking research would I see? Who would I meet? And most importantly, would the CS department be as amazing as everyone says it is? (Spoiler alert: it was!)\n\n\n\nArrival of students",

    "text": "Day 1: Diving into the Deep End\n\n\n\nProf Jessical Pan in inaugural address\n\n\n\nMorning: Breaking the Ice and Blowing Our Minds\nThe program kicked off with some ice-breakers that were actually fun (shocking, I know!). It was here that I met my squad – Rena, Yi Xin, Xinming, and Swastika. We were dubbed Group 12.\nOur first lecture was by Professor Chai Kah Hin, who dove headfirst into a mind-bender: “How will GenAI change PhD research?” As we wrapped our heads around this, Prof. Chai kept pushing us to ask “So what?” – making us really think about the impact and relevance of our research ideas.\nHe introduced us to this cool concept called the “ghost deck” – basically creating a storyboard of your presentation before getting into the nitty-gritty. Apparently, it’s a trick used by big shots like McKinsey to keep their presentations tight and logical. Mental note: must try this for my next class project!\n\n\n\nInaugural session\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon: Problem-Solving Like a Boss\nProf. Chai wasn’t done with us yet. His mantra of “Rough, Rapid, Right” stuck with me – the idea that making quick mistakes is actually a good thing. It’s all about learning fast and adapting faster. He also talked about horizontal and vertical logic in presentations, emphasizing the need for a clear, newspaper-like summary to hook your audience from the get-go. I could almost hear my future self thanking him during my next group presentation!\n\nPro tip: If you ever find yourself in Singapore, don’t miss out on trying the local kopi (coffee). It’s like rocket fuel for your brain during intense brainstorming sessions!\n\nWe rounded off the afternoon with a quick but eye-opening lecture by Dr. Amirhassan Monajemi on Generative AI. While a lot of it was familiar territory for us computer science geeks, seeing how it’s being applied across different fields at NUS was fascinating. It’s one thing to code an AI model, but seeing it potentially reshape entire industries? Although I found myself yawning during this lecture, I went out and took a Kopi to keep myself fresh. Actually Luo helped me to get to know about Kopi. I am attaching one guide here for your reference that I used over remaining week.\n\n\n\nKopi guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Lunch\n\n\n\n\nEvening: The Ethics of AI\nThe highlight of the day was hands down the session on AI and ethics by Simon Chesterman, Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law. This guy didn’t just lecture; he made us question everything we thought we knew about education and technology.\nDean Chesterman painted a vivid (and slightly unsettling) picture of the challenges universities face in the AI era. He threw some real curveballs at us: Are students customers or products? How do we evaluate people when AI can basically be a performance-enhancing drug for the mind?\nHe started by addressing the elephant in the room – the fear of AI turning into Skynet and taking over the world. While he didn’t completely rule out the possibility (gulp!), he was more concerned about how we humans might misuse this insanely powerful tech.\nOne thing that really stuck with me was his point about AI’s current limitations. Apparently, experts in specific fields can often spot AI’s mistakes in their domains quicker than you can say “ChatGPT.” It was a good reality check – AI might be smart, but it’s not omniscient (yet).\n\n\n\nAddress of Dean Simon Chesterman\n\n\nThe role of universities in this brave new AI world was a big talking point. Chesterman dropped a truth bomb – the age-old notion of professors knowing more than students is becoming as outdated as dial-up internet. With all the world’s knowledge at our fingertips (or more accurately, in our smartphones), universities need to focus on teaching us how to think, not just what to think.\nWe also dove into the ethical minefield of AI in various fields. In research, for instance, AI is doing some pretty cool stuff like speeding up drug discovery. But it also raises some tricky questions about plagiarism and the temptation to take shortcuts. Chesterman stressed the importance of separating the hype from reality when it comes to AI’s capabilities.\nOne of the most thought-provoking parts of the discussion was about responsibility in the AI era. Who’s to blame when an AI system messes up? The developers? The users? The data it was trained on? It’s like trying to nail jelly to a wall – slippery and complicated.\nAfter the session, some graduate students took us for a guided campus tour where I got to know about a lot of folks and had some interesting conversations with friends from Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n\nCampus Tour later that day\n\n\nOver dinner at a local hawker center near Clementi mall which is very close to University Town, our group, along with a couple of others, started with debate about the future of creativity and AI’s role in the arts. The diversity of viewpoints, influenced by our varied cultural backgrounds, made for a conversation which later ended up into a conversation of stories our stories to each other. I walked nearly 18km that day!! (eventually I breached 30km mark).",

    "text": "Day 2: From PhD Dreams to Workplace Scenarios\n\nMorning: PhD Tales That’ll Make You Laugh, Cry, and Think\nWe kicked off the day with a panel discussion featuring PhD candidates and recent graduates. Their stories were like a rollercoaster ride through academia – full of ups, downs, and unexpected loops. I was particularly struck by Dr. Boyd Anderson from New Zealand. This guy went from tinkering with embedded systems to revolutionizing how we teach – talk about a plot twist!\nThe biggest takeaway? Choosing the right supervisor and institution is like picking a life partner – it can make or break your academic journey. As one panelist put it, “The institution matters, but within it, your supervisor matters most.” Note to self: choose wisely!\n\n\nAfternoon: The Dark Side of Office Life\nProfessor Sandy Lim’s session on Workplace Incivility was an eye-opener. Using Structured Equation Modeling, she dropped some truth bombs about how rudeness can wreck a workplace.\nHere’s the tea:\n\nWorkplace incivility is more common than bad coffee in offices – a whopping 91% of employees in Asia reported experiencing it. Yikes!\nYour boss being rude affects you more than your annoying cubicle mate when it comes to wanting to quit.\nRudeness can spread through an office faster than gossip if left unchecked.\n\nIn the evening, we visited robotics lab and nano-materials lab. I got to handle an electron microscope and also play with a robotic car. That day, I along with other vegeterian friends, visited Anand Bhawan in Little India and had very home like dinner whereas our non-vegeterian friends enjoyed their meals in a restaurant inside NUS. We also went to clark quay for a walk.\n\n\n\nIn the nanomaterials lab\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics lab\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubation center for converting ideas to products\n\n\n\n\n\nRobotics lab",

    "text": "Day 3: From Nano-Wonders to Urban Jungles\n\nMorning: The Invisible Tech Running Our World\nProfessor Aaron Thean’s lecture on semiconductors was equivalent to diving into a sci-fi novel, except it was all real! He started with a bang: “If you don’t have semiconductors, you don’t have technology.”\nI was listening very mindfully that I was able to note these points only.\n\nMoore’s Law isn’t just about cramming more transistors onto a chip; it’s a testament to human ingenuity and stubbornness.\nCurrent AI, with far fewer parameters than our brains, guzzles energy like there’s no tomorrow – millions of times more than our noggins!\nHis research on rewritable chips, mimicking our brain’s plasticity, hinted at a future where our gadgets might think more like us. Exciting or terrifying? You decide!\n\nAs Prof. Thean geeked out about photonic chips and 3D chip architecture, I thought about future devices that might blur the line between silicon and neurons. Who knows, maybe one day our phones will literally read our minds!\n\n\nMorning: Harnessing Nature’s Power (Without Angering the Weather Gods)\nDr. Ghim Wei Ho’s session on solar technologies. Her research on tapping into low-grade heat fluctuations opened my eyes to energy sources we’ve been overlooking.\n\n\n\nDr. Ghim Wei Ho addressing us\n\n\nDid you know that roof gardens can actually make solar panels work better and last longer? It’s like giving your panels a cool, green hat. Nature and tech, working hand in hand – now that’s what I call smart! Niladri, a undergrad from UMich asked a ton of questions in this session.\n\n\nAfternoon: Transforming Concrete Jungles into Digital Paradises\nErvine Lin’s lecture on digitizing landscapes. He challenged us to see beyond trees and buildings to the designed environments shaping our cities and lives.\n\n\n\nVery interesting session by Ervine Lin\n\n\nSome “cool” takeaways:\n\nSingapore’s urban planning philosophy evolved from “Garden City” to “City in Gardens” – subtle difference, massive impact!\n3D scanning and reality capture tech are revolutionizing landscape architecture. It’s like SimCity, but for real!\nUnderstanding topography is crucial in urban planning, especially for flood prevention.\n\n\n\n\nAsking question\n\n\nAfter the lectures, we hopped on NUS buses for a tour of Singapore’s highlights – Gardens by the Bay, cloud forest, flower dome(nature on steroids!), the iconic Merlion (half-lion, half-fish, 100% Instagram-worthy (alothought I don’t use instagram yet), and some architectural marvels that made my neck hurt from looking up so much.\n\n\n\nVisit to Gardens by the bay\n\n\nThe evening was a culinary adventure through Little India and Chinatown. As we stuffed our faces with everything we liked, I marvelled at how this tiny island nation had become a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. It was like taking a world tour without leaving the city!\n\n\n\nNear Merlion\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine Bay sands\n\n\n\n\n\nInside Marine Bay Sands Casino\n\n\n\n\n\nInside flower dome\n\n\n\n\n\nIn front of Merlion",

    "text": "Day 4: Health, Wealth, and the Art of Not Boring People to Death\n\nMorning: AI: Your New Healthcare Bestie?\nProfessor Dean Ho’s session on N-of-1 Digital Health felt like peering into the future of medicine. His WisDM and CURATE platform, which uses AI to tailor treatments to individual patients, sounded like something out of a sci-fi movie.\nKey mind-blowers:\n\nThe old “one-size-fits-all” approach to medicine? Yeah, that’s so last century.\nAI could be the key to cracking the code on personalized cancer treatments. Take that, cancer!\nIn healthcare data, it’s all about “stories over snapshots” – looking at trends rather than isolated data points. It’s like Netflix for your health, but instead of recommending shows, it’s saving lives.\n\n\n\n\nAfter talking with Prof. Ho\n\n\nProf. Ho also dove into the gamification of healthcare. Imagine earning points for taking your meds or hitting your step goal – suddenly, being healthy becomes as addictive as your favorite mobile game! I bombarded him with questions after the session (sorry, not sorry!), and to his credit, he answered every single one with patience and enthusiasm. It’s not every day you get to pick the brain of someone who’s literally changing the face of healthcare!\n\n\nAfternoon: Economics in the Age of AI\nThe lecture on economic strategies for the 5.0 era was like trying to predict the weather – fascinating, complex, and slightly terrifying. The key takeaways?\n\nWe need to rewire our brains when it comes to economic development. The old rules? They’re about as relevant as a floppy disk in 2024.\nIt’s time to question everything we thought we knew about economics.\nCrafting economic strategies that play nice with AI and automation is the new holy grail.\n\nAs I sat there, furiously scribbling notes, I was thinking: in this brave new world, would my future job even exist? Or would I be competing with a hyper-intelligent AI for that corner office? (Note to self: start being nicer to Claude and Alexa, just in case.)\n\n\nAfternoon: The Art of Not Boring People (In Three Minutes or Less)\nThe 3-Minute Thesis (3MT) workshop by Rafi Rasheed and Jason Banta was like a crash course in not putting people to sleep while talking about your research. Their golden rules:\n\nStart with a bang! Your opening line should grab attention faster than a cat video on social media.\nUse stories that people can relate to.\nProblem, solution, impact – the essentials of any good pitch. If you can’t explain it to your grandparentts, you’re doing it wrong.\n\nLater before evening Prof Johannes Widodo took us to architectural tour of academic building of department of architecture.\n\n\n\nDuring the tour with Prof Johannes\n\n\nWe spent the evening practicing our pitches, giving each other feedback, and trying not to panic at the thought presenting the poster in front of everyone. It was challenging, hilarious, and oddly exhilarating. Since next day was presentation day, we did not go for any outdoor adventures. We visited the merchandise store in NUS, bought few things, had some snacks and started working on presentations. Although our group did not make it to finals (ig we missed it with very small margin becasue of too much text on poster), we enjoyed the work we did and got to learn a lot from posters of other groups.\n\n\n\nPreparing Poster Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all nighter work",

    "text": "Day 5: Battling Urban Heat and Jamming with AI\n\nMorning: Saving the World, One Cool Roof at a Time\nProfessor Wong Nyuk Hien’s lecture on the CoolNUS Project was an eye-opener on urban climate challenges. Who thought buildings could throw tantrums and create their own weather?\nCool facts (pun intended):\n\nTurns out, tall buildings are like giant sunglasses for cities during the day. They create a “Cool Island Effect” – nature’s air conditioning!\nIn Singapore, cranking up the AC by just 1°C can spike cooling demand by 7-10%.\nUrban greenery isn’t just pretty – it’s a secret weapon against rising temperatures. Time to turn those concrete jungles into actual jungles!\n\nThe best part? Seeing how AI and 3D graphics are being used to design cooler cities. It’s like SimCity, but with real-world impact!\n\n\nAfternoon: When AI Drops the Beat\nThe program finale with Francis Tan exploring AI and Music was mind-blowing. We played around with tools like SUNO and UDIO, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in music creation.\nFrancis broke down the recipe for a good song:\n\nAuthenticity - real feelings, not just auto-tuned emotions\nConnection - themes that hit you right in the feels\nCatchiness - melodies that stick in your head like that annoying jingle from that one commercial\n\nAs we experimented with AI-generated tunes, everyone debated about the future of creativity. Can a machine really capture the soul of music? Or are we on the brink of a new era of human-AI collaboration in art? The jury’s still out, but one thing’s for sure – the music industry is in for one wild ride!\n\n\n\nPoster Presentation on final day",

    "text": "The Grand Finale: Posters, Presentations, and Goodbyes\nAs the program neared its end, our group pulled an all-nighter on second last night to put the finishing touches on our poster and presentation. Fueled by a mix of excitement, caffeine, and the fear of embarrassing ourselves in front of some of the brightest minds in academia, we worked through the night. It was exhausting, exhilarating, and oddly fun – a perfect microcosm of the entire week.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Poster Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the last session greeting to everyone and wishing them good luck!\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Dean Jessica Pan and Prof Kah-Hin Chai\n\n\n\n\n\nSentosa Islands\n\n\nThe next day, as everyone presented their projects, I was blown away by the creativity and innovation on display. From AI-powered solutions for sustainable agriculture to novel approaches in quantum computing, the range of ideas was staggering. As the program officially came to a close, a bittersweet feeling settled over us all. We’d come as strangers from different universities but were bonded so close during such short period. That evening we went to an extra mile to squeeze out joy from every moment. We visited so many tourist attractions. We also went to Casino as entry was free for foreginers (just to see it from inside!). This is the day which made me breach 30km mark. Also, after coming back to U Town around 2AM, we wandered inside U Town till 4:30 AM. Next day, half of us came together to the aiport, bid farewell to each other. Everyone became so emotional at this point that some among us literally sobbing. I said goodbye to everyone. But the jounery together was not over, we will spend some time together remotely, to prepare our 3MTs and will present them to the jury.\nTo anyone considering applying to the NUS Young Fellowship Program – do it! It’s an unparalleled opportunity to immerse yourself in a world-class research environment, engage with leading academics, and connect with exceptional peers from around the globe. The program offers a perfect blend of academic rigor and cultural exploration, all set against the backdrop of Singapore’s unique blend of tradition and innovation.\n\n\n\nRoaming around airport\n\n\nUpdate : 3MT is done. It was really really good to listen to knowledge-dense pitches.\n\n\n\nLeaving for the airport together\n\n\nAfter farewell, I roamed around the airport for an hour or two with few friends who were still to board their flights. Then I sat at starbucks for 2 hours since my flight was delayed beause of bad weather. It was here that I finetuned my digital journal. As I boarded my flight home alone, I couldn’t help but feel that this was just the beginning. The connections made, the knowledge gained, and the inspiration sparked during this week will undoubtedly shape my academic journey for years to come. The NUS Young Fellowship Program didn’t just show me the cutting edge of research and innovation – it invited me to be a part of it.\n\n\n\nSwastika, Yi, Lili (Luo Xinming), Rena and Me\n\n\nNote : My notes were very scattered, I have taken help from Claude Sonnet 3.5 on 30 Sept 2024 to make them coherent.",

    "text": "Task 1: Cracking the Code of Tweet Popularity\n\nThe Data Dilemma\nOur first hurdle? The dataset was as skewed as a politician’s promise. We knew we needed more data to train a robust model. So, we went on a data hunt, integrating tweets from the top 20 Twitter accounts and a massive dataset from Hugging Face. We set our sights high, filtering for tweets with over 5,000 likes in English.\n\n\nEmbedding Our Way to Success\nEnter BERTweet, our knight in shining armor. We used it to extract embeddings from the tweet content, considering everything from the inferred company to the username and date. It was like giving our model a pair of super-powered glasses to see the intricate details of each tweet.\n\n\nThe Classifier-Regressor Dream Team\nWe trained a classifier to categorize tweets into engagement classes, ranging from the humble “0-100 likes” to the viral “100,000-1,000,000 likes”. But we didn’t stop there. We crafted six specialized regressors, one for each engagement class, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. It was like having a team of experts, each specializing in a different level of tweet popularity.\n\n\nA Novel Approach to Evaluation\nHere’s where we got creative. Instead of just looking at RMSE, we focused on predicting the order of likes. Why? Because in the real world, knowing if your tweet will be a big hit or a small ripple is often more valuable than knowing the exact number of likes.",

    "text": "Task 2: The Art of Tweet Generation\n\nA Picture is Worth a Thousand Likes\nWe realized that tweets aren’t just about text. Images and videos play a huge role in engagement. So, we built a two-stage pipeline:\n\nCaption Generation: We deployed Visual Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVa and CLIP to generate detailed captions for images.\nLLM Fine-tuning: We then fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) with these textual representations.\n\n\n\nThe Audio Twist\nFor videos, we took an innovative approach. Instead of traditional video captioning, we used audio captioning. It was faster and compute-efficient.\n\n\nThe LLM Showdown\nAfter an exhaustive evaluation of various LLMs, we settled on LLaMA. We fine-tuned it with our dataset, turning it into a tweet-generating powerhouse.",
