We have already burned through a quarter of this century. India stood at its threshold with a solemn promise to own it. I remember when we were all charged up as kids that she would be a superpower by 2020, a goal set by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. It was ambitious, it was inspiring, and it gave us something to strive for collectively as a nation. We indeed got many things right and must be proud of those achievements, while we also missed many opportunities. We cannot rest on partial victories. The mission is Viksit Bharat 2047. We must at least be a upper-middle-income nation, although that cannot be our sole ambition. The life of her citizens must be the north star. To achieve this, I propose a framework with a three-prong heuristic through which most policy and directives can take cue. First, prevent unnatural death. Second, increase life expectancy. Third, enrich that long and healthy life.

### **The First Prong: Prevent Unnatural Death**

The most immediate duty of governance is the preservation of life. We must aggressively arrest unnatural deaths. This encompasses everything from maternal mortality to road accidents, from malnutrition to preventable diseases, from farmer suicides to industrial accidents. Every single unnatural death is in some way a failure of governance, a talent lost, a family shattered, and a future denied.

When citizens do not feel safe, when accidents claim lives that could have been saved, or when disasters strike without adequate response systems, we fail at the basics. We need automated SOS alarm systems at scale that can respond to emergencies swiftly and effectively. This safety net must extend to economic survival as well. The surge in regional inequality that has forced millions to migrate must be reversed through townification. More of our population needs to shift out from agriculture, and we need to modernize our farming with machines and automation to reduce the burden on farmers struggling under economic distress.

National security is equally vital to preventing the loss of life and sovereignty. Digging a well when thirsty cannot be the national strategy. Two things India heavily imports are defense equipment and energy. We cannot afford to be highly dependent on others for our security or our energy needs. We must be competent in our strengths for a free-market world, and simultaneously, we must build self-reliance in every sector. A bit far fetched under this prong, we also need to ramp up space exploration. 

### **The Second Prong: Extending Life Span**

Once survival is secured, we must focus on the span of existence. Increasing life expectancy requires a holistic approach to health and environment. It begins before birth. For a nation with demography as one of its strongest assets, every child born must have access to proper nutrition in the first thousand days of life, not just from birth. This is when the foundation for a healthy, productive life is laid.

The reach of healthcare services must expand through targeted interventions. We need more primary health centers, more trained medical professionals in rural areas, and better health insurance coverage. Preventive healthcare should be prioritized over curative healthcare.

However, medicine alone cannot guarantee a long life if our environment is toxic. Our cities need to be livable, breathable, and beautiful. No more should our cities be designed for cars. They should be designed for people, for walking, cycling, and using public transit, with parks, lush greenery, lakes, and playgrounds. Clean air and green spaces directly impact how long and how well we live. The transition to renewable energy is not just about economics; it is about securing our future in a world increasingly constrained by climate change.

We must also guard against the forces that shorten life from within. Addictions of different kinds are giving today's youth a slow death. Whether substance abuse, screen addiction, or the more subtle addictions to instant gratification, we are losing a generation to these forces. We need better awareness, better treatment facilities, and a society that does not stigmatize those seeking help.

### **The Third Prong: Enriching the Journey**

Yet, what is the point of living long if that life lacks meaning, opportunity, beauty, and dignity? Education, cultural enrichment, economic opportunity, social harmony, and environmental aesthetics make life worth living.

This enrichment begins with education. The promise of education as the great equalizer remained largely unfulfilled. We need great public schooling, and institutions like Navodaya need big upgrades. The school curriculum needs to be more explorative but also harder. We can make it accessible without making it easy or dumbing it down. Higher education needs a revolution. The way to improve education in India is to put the best national and international minds as faculty. They won't do it for salary; they will do it because they care. Teaching in native languages and Ancient Indian Knowledge are good initiatives but are very least impactful when fundamentals like basic infrastructure, quality teaching, student-teacher ratios, and learning outcomes are not fixed. Primary and secondary education must sensitise young adults on essential topics. We must arrest vulgarity in society spreading through mass media. Scientific temperament needs to reclaim front seat again.

We must create an ecosystem where talent thrives. The most important thing is having cities or even remote locations where foreign top talent can come, stay, and work. Brain drain has worsened because our best minds perceive limited pathways at home. When our environment fails to retain talent or attract global expertise, we compromise our ability to extend both the length and quality of life for all citizens.

Prosperity is the engine of a rich life. The means to prosperity is moving low-skilled labor to high-skilled jobs, which requires rethinking vocational training and labor laws. We must look beyond IT and services to manufacturing, green technology, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Artificial Intelligence and robotics hold immense promise. We must aggressively push for space exploration and aim for at least three spots out of the top 10 valued companies in the world. Furthermore, as a key data source in the modern world, we should monetize our data or control it with strong laws. Our demographic dividend can be our data dividend.

Cultural and aesthetic richness is equally important. Indian tourism is woefully underexploited. We have culture, history, and diversity that almost no country can match. Promoting tourism and our soft power through cinema, music, food, spirituality can open doors that hard power cannot. At the same time, we need to travel more internationally and expose ourselves more to other cultures. The world is full of beauty and we should embrace it in our lifetimes. We want efficiency, but we also crave beauty. Jumbled electric wires are aesthetically ugly. Our cities need to be pleasing to the eye, for aesthetics impact our mental well-being. 

Finally, a rich life requires a just society. Making sure that half of India gets representation in parliament is important; the number of women MPs has to increase rapidly. We need to strive for a society where individuals vote as citizens first, as Indians, not as members of narrower identities. The communalism offered to aspiring youthful India must end. Civil servants should have the courage and integrity to suggest what is best for the people. We need technologies like blockchain and ZKPs to make governance more efficient, transparent, and accountable.

### Compounding

Compounding has immense power. To allow compounding of national progress, policies by and large should outlive the governments. Dialogue and broad consensus, decentralisation of power with clearer responsibilities helps ensure compounding by avoiding a single point of failure. Also, to not discourage thriving states, we need a better fund distribution algorithm which rewards good governance but also helps lagging states to catch up in other than financial means. Freebies, especially on backdrop of elections are extremely harmful as they take away the funds otherwise available for improving economic health. Radical technological innovation catalyses compounding manifold and IP protection, easier access to capital, no unnecessary bureaucratic red tape, culture of celebrating risk-taking and forgiving failures will help this happen.

### **The Pledge of 2047**

We should ask, as a net result, does this help improve life? If the answer to all three prongs is no, we should reconsider. We don’t need premature juvenile pompous declarations of victory, What India truly needs is a silent redemption that is patient, persistent work where all arms of democracy fulfill their duties diligently. We need scientists in their labs, teachers in their classrooms, doctors in their clinics, engineers at their drawing boards, farmers in their fields, civil servants at their desks, and everyone and all working towards making India better.

By the end of 2047, when India celebrates a century of independence, we should be able to say that we redeemed the pledge our forefathers made. The ambition of the greatest people of our generation now must be to wipe every tear from every eye and then bring a smile to every lip. That is the north star. That is the ultimate filter.

The clock is ticking, and our destination 2047 is not as far away as it seems. Let us make sure we enjoy the journey. This is a road we must take because India deserves better, and her children deserve better. Humanity deserves better. Let us Make India Great Again, a country that is prosperous, just, free, and beautiful.
