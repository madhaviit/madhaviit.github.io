## India@75 through lens of Panditji 



Today, we celebrate 75 years of independence, hard-fought and earned through the sacrifices of millions and millions. This is our moment, and we own it. At this auspicious moment, there are tons of opportunities and millions of traps ahead of us. The question is, are we wise enough to avoid the traps and grab the opportunities? Moreover, where do we, as a nation, look ahead?

*Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny; and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom*. These were the first few words of the First Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, from one of his greatest speeches when India became Independent. India needs to try to make herself an outward-looking and utterly free society. Free from fear and full of confidence that we as a nation will march together to greatness where each of us feels included. India must free herself from divisions of religions and castes and devote herself to science and innovation.

>We are about to complete The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. According to our honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, this is an enthralling year filled with the elixir of energy of independence; the elixir of inspiration of the warriors of the freedom struggle; the elixir of new ideas and pledges; and the elixir of Aatmanirbharta. Therefore, this Mahotsav is a festival of awakening of the nation; festival of fulfilling the dream of good governance; and the festival of global peace and development. As we enter the Amrit Kal, let us look at this moment distantly.

*A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India, and her people, and to the still larger cause of humanity.* We must feel the freedom of that long-suppressed soul when we think about acting selfishly against the national interest. *We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again.* Everyone must feel the pledge to serve this country in every way possible. We shall not forget the sacrifices of our forefathers who lived every breath to improve our beloved nation. The utterance that the soul found was of democracy and liberal values. We shall embrace it wholeheartedly, keeping aside momentary political gains. The diversity in India shall be celebrated with a sense of unity and not uniformity. There will be chaos in a nation of our size and diversity, but it should be constructive. India must move, slowly or fast, but in the forward direction. No way we can afford to go back.

*The ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye.* This is the crux. We are obligated to uplift those who have not been advanced enough to have a life with even a bare minimum standard of living. We need to raise even those bare minimum standards as fast as possible. It is said that education is tigress’ milk. We also need to build world-class institutions for mutual exchange of wisdom from other nations. India should also make space research more collaborative so that even the sky is not our limit.

*To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.* We shall embark on values of tolerance that we inherited. We shall be aware and brave enough that our tolerance may not be conceived as a weakness. We are a young nation. We must appreciate the successful youth, but we seriously need to look at a generation that has been completely lost in the virtual world, which I fear threatens the real zeal for a better life, education, and opportunities. The voices of women were heard and empowered. Nevertheless, still, we are far from saying that we have liberated the ladies of this nation from patriarchy. Serious concern has been that parliamentary practices are deteriorating year by year. We need a fix on this. We need to deal with environmental challenges while taking entire humanity on board. And finally, we need consciousness. The greatness of India shall lie at the bottom of our hearts, and the urge for betterment should be at the top of our minds. We must celebrate the achievements of these 75 years and look at the future with a clear goal of a world of happiness and prosperity because the idealism of today can be tomorrow’s realism.
