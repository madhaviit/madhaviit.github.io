Have recently joined Samsung R&D Institute India Bangalore as a Software Engineer after completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. 

Like to read. The reading spectrum stretches from math-heavy research papers to fictional novels. Both extremes of this spectrum help me understand everything in between much better. Focus my research on significant challenges and topics that amuse me. Find coding and debugging very engrossing. Generative AI, robotics and computer vision fascinate me, and at the same time, inclined to study the privacy and security aspects of its development as well as applications.  

Express myself with a pen a lot resulting in ~~attempts~~ ~~for~~ writing poems and jotting down thoughts regularly. Put a few of them on the internet too. Spend a lot of time reading all kinds of books. All this has led me to have an eye for spotting inefficiencies, and come up with ways to terminate them. Constantly try to keep myself updated on my domains of keen interest (a few are economics, algorithms, literature, law, and technology). Enjoy engaging in thought-provoking debates and discussions. A big-time foodie and nature lover, always seeking new culinary experiences(vegetarian) and outdoor adventures.



<!-- I a with a keen interest in development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. Apart from Computer Science, I love to explore Economics, Law and History. I am currently a MAGPIE Summer Intern at [Samsung Research Institute Banglore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). Know professional side of me from [CV](CV.qmd). Apart from technical blogs, I also ~~try to~~ write poems. The structure of this website is inspired by [Sayak's site](https://sayak.dev/).

- I love exploring new technologies in order to solve real-world problems.  I have an eye to spot and terminate inefficieny.
- I am amazed by Generative AI. Eventually intrigued by the privacy and security aspects of it, both in its development and application. Actively trying to expand my understanding in these areas.
- Many of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/madhaviit?tab=repositories). Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhav-kadam/) for collaborations or engaging discussions. I don't post frequently on my official [twitter](https://twitter.com/kpmadhav18) account, but I do follow very interesting set of people.
- In my free time, I mostly enjoy reading books.   -->
