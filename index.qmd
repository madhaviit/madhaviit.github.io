I am working as SWE at Samsung R&D Institute India Bangalore in Samsung Pay / Digital Wallet team after completing my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering along with a minor in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. 

I am an avid reader. My reading spectrum stretches from math-heavy research papers to fictional novels. Both extremes of this spectrum help me understand everything in between much better. I focus my research on significant challenges and topics that amuse me. I find coding and debugging very engrossing. Generative AI, robotics and computer vision fascinate me, and at the same time, I am inclined to study the privacy, security and economic aspects of its development as well as applications.  

I express myself with a pen a lot resulting in ~~attempts~~ ~~for~~ writing poems and jotting down thoughts regularly. Have put a few of them here too. 

All this has led me to have an eye for spotting inefficiencies, and come up with ways to terminate them. I constantly try to keep myself updated on my domains of keen interest (Economics, Literature, Algorithms, Biology, Law and Technology). I enjoy engaging in thought-provoking debates and discussions. I am big-time foodie and nature lover, always seeking new culinary experiences(vegetarian) and outdoor adventures.



<!-- I a with a keen interest in development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. Apart from Computer Science, I love to explore Economics, Law and History. I am currently a MAGPIE Summer Intern at [Samsung Research Institute Banglore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). Know professional side of me from [CV](CV.qmd). Apart from technical blogs, I also ~~try to~~ write poems. The structure of this website is inspired by [Sayak's site](https://sayak.dev/).

- I love exploring new technologies in order to solve real-world problems.  I have an eye to spot and terminate inefficieny.
- I am amazed by Generative AI. Eventually intrigued by the privacy and security aspects of it, both in its development and application. Actively trying to expand my understanding in these areas.
- Many of my projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/madhaviit?tab=repositories). Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhav-kadam/) for collaborations or engaging discussions. I don't post frequently on my official [twitter](https://twitter.com/kpmadhav18) account, but I do follow very interesting set of people.
- In my free time, I mostly enjoy reading books.   -->
